This lab focuses on OSI layer analysis and simulation-based network diagnostics using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes a basic routed network topology with a PC, switches, routers, and a server. The task is to use simulation mode to observe how different types of traffic traverse the network and identify the corresponding OSI layers.

Devices Used:

2 × Cisco 2911 Routers (R1, R2)
2 × Cisco 2960 Switches (SW1, SW2)
1 × PC (PC1)
1 × Server (SRV1)

IP Addressing:

- PC1: DHCP assigned from server
- SRV1: 192.168.1.100/24
- Router Interfaces:
  - R1 G0/0: 192.168.1.1/24
  - R1 G0/1: 10.0.0.1/24
  - R2 G0/0: 10.0.0.2/24

Learning Objectives:

- Use simulation mode to inspect and analyze traffic (Layer 2 to Layer 7)
- Observe protocol behavior such as DHCP (Layer 7), ARP (Layer 2), ICMP (Layer 3)
- Release and renew IP address of PC1 to generate Layer 7 traffic
- Understand traffic flow through routers and across subnets

Tasks:

1. Enable simulation mode and capture the flow of traffic.
2. Identify OSI layers involved in DHCP, ICMP, and data communication.
3. Analyze the role of switches and routers in packet forwarding.
