Day 30 – TCP & UDP (Transport Layer Protocols)

This session covers the fundamentals of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), key protocols at the Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.

Topics covered:

TCP vs UDP differences

TCP 3-way handshake

Characteristics and use cases of UDP

Port numbers and their importance

Connection-oriented vs connectionless protocols

Examples: HTTP, DNS, TFTP, etc.

===================================================================================================================Day 31 – Wireshark Demo: TCP & UDP (Lab)

This lab demonstrates the use of Wireshark to capture and analyze TCP and UDP traffic. It includes practical examples of file transfers using FTP (TCP-based) and TFTP (UDP-based).

Topics covered:

Capturing live network packets using Wireshark

Analyzing TCP 3-way handshake and session termination

Observing UDP communication with TFTP

Understanding TCP flags: SYN, ACK, FIN

Exploring UDP headers and behavior

Using filters in Wireshark for targeted analysis
