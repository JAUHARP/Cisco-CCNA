Explores Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) with step-by-step explanation of subnetting a Class C network into subnets of different sizes. Covers:
- Calculating subnet masks based on host requirements
- Assigning subnets efficiently without wasting IP addresses
- Planning hierarchical IP addressing in networks


Hands-on lab exercise implementing VLSM subnetting. Demonstrates:
- Planning and assigning IP subnets based on varying host needs
- Applying subnet masks and verifying configuration
- Efficient IP address utilization in network design
