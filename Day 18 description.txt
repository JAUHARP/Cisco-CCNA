Day 18 - VLANs (Part 3) - CCNA 200-301

This session covers advanced VLAN concepts and introduces inter-VLAN routing. Topics include VLAN trunking, 802.1Q tagging, router-on-a-stick configuration, and enabling communication between different VLANs. A hands-on Packet Tracer lab demonstrates how to configure and troubleshoot inter-VLAN routing in a simulated network. Part of the full CCNA 200-301 course.

Day 18 Lab – VLANs (Part 3) – CCNA 200‑301

This lab video dives into the practical steps of configuring VLANs and inter‑VLAN routing using Packet Tracer. You’ll work through:

Setting up multiple VLANs on switches

Trunking configuration to carry VLAN traffic

Router-on-a-stick setup for inter‑VLAN communication

Verifying connectivity across VLANs

Troubleshooting common configuration issues

A hands-on simulation reinforces the theoretical concepts from VLAN theory, and it's part of the complete CCNA 200‑301 series
