Day 17 – VLANs (Part 2)

This session continues the VLAN configuration from the previous lesson. It covers how to implement inter-VLAN communication using router-on-a-stick method in Cisco Packet Tracer. The video is part of the CCNA 200-301 training series.

Topics covered:

VLAN configuration on multiple switches

Trunk port setup and native VLANs

Router sub-interface configuration

Inter-VLAN routing

Troubleshooting VLAN and trunk issues

Tools used:

Cisco Packet Tracer

Basic router and switch CLI

Objective:
Learn to configure VLANs and route between them using a router-on-a-stick setup. Practice identifying and fixing common misconfigurations.

Day 17 – VLANs (Part 3)

Continuing the VLAN series in the CCNA 200-301 course, this lesson dives deeper into VLAN trunking, DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol), and VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Topics covered:

Access vs trunk port configuration

802.1Q tagging and native VLANs

Dynamic Trunking Protocol modes (auto, desirable)

VLAN pruning best practices

VTP modes (server/client/transparent) and configuration

Hands-on Packet Tracer lab exercises

Learning goals:

Configure inter-switch trunks and set native VLANs

Understand and apply VLAN pruning for security and efficiency

Recognize DTP behavior and disable unwanted auto-negotiation

Use VTP with awareness of its benefits and risks

Tools used:

Cisco Packet Tracer

Cisco switch CLI
