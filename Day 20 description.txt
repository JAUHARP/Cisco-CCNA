Day 20 – Spanning Tree Protocol (Part 1) from Jeremy’s IT Lab CCNA 200-301 video series. The video introduces the basics of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), explaining its purpose in preventing Layer 2 switching loops and ensuring a loop-free topology in redundant network designs.

Key concepts covered include:

The need for STP in switched networks

Root bridge election process

STP port roles: Root Port, Designated Port, and Non-Designated (Blocked) Port

Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) and their function

Port states (Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding)

Basic STP configuration and observation in a Cisco Packet Tracer lab

This lab is essential for understanding how switches maintain loop-free environments using STP and how to configure and verify it in a simulated Cisco network.

Day 20 – Spanning Tree Protocol (Part 1): Analyzing STP

This lab focuses on understanding how Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) prevents Layer 2 loops in switched networks. Using a redundant topology of multiple interconnected switches, this exercise demonstrates how STP selects a root bridge and determines which switch ports should forward traffic and which should be blocked to ensure a loop-free environment.

Key Concepts Covered:

Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs)

Root Bridge election process

Port roles: Root Port, Designated Port, and Non-Designated (Blocked) Port

STP port states: Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding

Path cost calculation and port role assignment

STP CLI commands: show spanning-tree, show spanning-tree vlan X

Lab Objectives:

Build a redundant switched topology

Analyze which switch becomes the root bridge based on Bridge ID (priority + MAC address)

Manually determine port roles and expected STP behavior

Verify port roles and states using CLI commands

Observe how STP prevents loops by blocking redundant paths

This lab provides essential hands-on practice for CCNA candidates, helping build a solid foundation in Layer 2 redundancy and loop prevention using standard IEEE 802.1D STP.
