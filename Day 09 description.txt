 Day 09  - VLAN Configuration and Trunking::
These lab sessions focused on implementing VLANs and VLAN trunking in a switched network using Cisco Packet Tracer:

Day 9 - VLAN Configuration::

Created and managed multiple VLANs on switches

Assigned specific ports to different VLANs

Verified VLAN configurations using show vlan and show interfaces

Improved network segmentation and reduced broadcast traffic

 Day 9 - VLAN Trunking::

Configured trunk ports between switches using switchport mode trunk

Enabled communication of multiple VLANs across switches

Verified trunk links with show interfaces trunk

Demonstrated efficient inter-switch VLAN communication

These labs strengthened my understanding of VLAN implementation, trunking concepts, and Layer 2 network management.
