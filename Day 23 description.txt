Day 23 – EtherChannel | CCNA 200-301

This session covers EtherChannel, a key concept in CCNA that allows bundling of multiple physical links into a single logical link for increased bandwidth and redundancy.

Topics Covered:
- What is EtherChannel and its purpose
- Benefits: redundancy, load balancing, and easier management
- Protocols used: 
  - LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
  - PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol)
  - Static mode (on)
- Configuration of port-channel interfaces
- Mode options: active/passive/desirable/auto/on
- Key verification commands:
  - show etherchannel summary
  - show interfaces port-channel
  - show run interface port-channel

Lab Includes:
- EtherChannel configuration using LACP
- Grouping of interfaces into port-channels
- Load balancing demonstration
- Verifying link aggregation and redundancy handling

Day 23 Lab – EtherChannel | CCNA 200-301

This lab demonstrates the configuration and verification of EtherChannel, which combines multiple physical links into one logical link to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy.

Lab Objectives:
- Configure EtherChannel using LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
- Set up interfaces for port-channel grouping
- Apply trunk configuration to the port-channel
- Verify EtherChannel setup and status

Lab Tasks:
1. Connect two switches with two or more Ethernet cables
2. Configure interfaces on both switches with:
   interface range fa0/1 - 2
     channel-group 1 mode active
3. Configure the logical port-channel interface:
   interface port-channel 1
     switchport mode trunk
4. Verify configuration using:
   - show etherchannel summary
   - show interfaces port-channel
   - show run interface port-channel

Expected Outcome:
- All grouped interfaces should operate as one logical link
- Proper trunking on port-channel
- EtherChannel status shows as “P” (in port-channel)

This lab reinforces the understanding of link aggregation and helps in preparing for related topics in the CCNA 200-301 exam.
