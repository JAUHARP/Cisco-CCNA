Day 26 Lab-configuring ospf

This lab focuses on configuring single-area OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) as introduced in Day 26 of the CCNA 200-301 series by Jeremy’s IT Lab. Three routers (R1, R2, and R3) are connected in a triangular topology, each with a loopback interface representing a unique network. The objective is to enable OSPF on all routers, assign router IDs, and advertise directly connected networks within Area 0 using wildcard masks. Key verification steps include checking OSPF neighbor relationships, viewing the OSPF routing table, and inspecting the link-state database. Passive interfaces are configured on loopbacks to prevent unnecessary OSPF hello packets. This lab helps reinforce foundational OSPF concepts such as neighborship, LSDB synchronization, and route learning across a single OSPF area.
