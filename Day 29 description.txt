First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP) Lab – CCNA Day 29

This lab demonstrates the configuration and verification of First Hop Redundancy Protocols using HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol), based on Jeremy’s IT Lab CCNA 200‑301 series – Day 29.

Lab Features:
- Configures HSRP v2 between two routers (R1 and R2)
- Assigns a virtual IP address as the default gateway for hosts
- Sets router priorities and enables preemption for Active/Standby roles
- Verifies FHRP functionality with show commands, ARP table checks, and failover simulation

Learning Outcomes:
- Understand the purpose of FHRP in providing gateway redundancy
- Configure HSRP to ensure uninterrupted host connectivity
- Test and verify failover and recovery between redundant routers

Includes:
- Full router configurations
- Test results (ping, ARP, and failover behavior)
- Topology diagram and setup notes

HSRP Configuration Lab – CCNA Day 29

This lab demonstrates Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) configuration for gateway redundancy, based on Jeremy's IT Lab – CCNA 200‑301 Day 29.

Lab Features:
- Configures HSRP v2 between two routers (R1 and R2)
- Sets virtual IP as the default gateway for client PCs
- Uses priority and preemption to control Active/Standby router roles
- Verifies failover and recovery using ping, show standby, and ARP commands

Learning Outcomes:
- Understand how HSRP ensures network resilience
- Configure routers for seamless gateway failover
- Apply default gateway and ARP principles in LAN setups

Includes router configurations and test results for both failover and recovery scenarios.
