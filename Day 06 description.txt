Understand how Ethernet LAN switches handle MAC address learning and ARP resolution during initial communication on a network with an empty MAC and ARP table.

Tasks Completed:

Simulated a network with 4 PCs and 2 switches using Packet Tracer.

Observed ARP and ICMP (ping) message propagation from PC1 to PC3 when MAC and ARP tables were initially empty.

Used Simulation Mode to monitor ARP broadcast, MAC learning, and ICMP echo/reply paths.

Verified MAC address learning using show mac address-table on switches.

Demonstrated MAC address table clearing and re-learning behavior through repeated pings.

Key Learnings:

Switches flood frames when the destination MAC is unknown.

ARP requests are broadcast to find the destination MAC.

Switches dynamically learn MAC addresses from incoming frames.

MAC tables are vital for efficient frame forwarding within LANs.
