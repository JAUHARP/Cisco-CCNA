This lab simulates a layered network topology with hierarchical design using multiple routers, switches, PCs, and a server. The objective is to practice appropriate cabling, understand distance limitations, and reinforce structured network layout using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Devices Used:

4 × Cisco Routers (R1, R2, R3, R4)
8 × Cisco Switches (SW1 to SW8)
3 × PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3)
1 × Server (SRV1)

Distance Constraints and Cable Types:

- R1–R2 (50 meters): Use Copper Straight-through Cable
- R1–R3 (3 kilometers): Use Fiber Cable
- R3–R4 (250 meters): Use Fiber or appropriate media
- Switch to PC/Server: Use Copper Straight-through
- Switch to Switch: Use Copper Crossover Cable (assume Auto MDI-X is off)

Learning Objectives:

- Understand correct use of cabling types in different scenarios
- Implement and connect a scalable, multi-layer network
- Apply distance-based cable selection in Packet Tracer
- Reinforce concepts of access, distribution, and core layers
