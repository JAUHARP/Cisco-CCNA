Day 31 – IPv6 (Part 1)

This session introduces IPv6, the successor to IPv4, designed to solve the problem of IP address exhaustion and improve overall network efficiency.

Topics covered:

Need for IPv6 and limitations of IPv4

IPv6 address format and structure (128-bit, hexadecimal notation)

Types of IPv6 addresses: Unicast, Multicast, Anycast

IPv6 header simplification compared to IPv4

Basics of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)

Transition strategies between IPv4 and IPv6

Day 31 – Lab: Configuring IPv6 (Part 1)

This lab focuses on hands-on IPv6 configuration using Cisco CLI in a simulated environment.

Topics covered:

Assigning IPv6 addresses to router interfaces

Enabling IPv6 routing using ipv6 unicast-routing

Verifying IPv6 configuration with show commands

Understanding link-local vs global unicast addresses

Using ping and show ipv6 interface to test connectivity

Basic network communication between IPv6-enabled routers and PCs
