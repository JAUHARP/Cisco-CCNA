Today’s session explained the complete journey of a packet from source to destination in a network.

Topics Covered:

The entire process of sending a packet to a remote destination

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): mapping IP to MAC address

Encapsulation & De-encapsulation: how data is wrapped/unwrapped through OSI layers

Key steps at each layer including headers/trailers added and removed

This session reinforces core CCNA topics like data transmission flow, device interaction, and protocol functions across the network path.

 Lab Day 12 - Life of a Packet (CCNA)
Objective:
Understand and analyze the complete path a packet takes across a network when it is sent from one host to another, including the MAC address resolution and the encapsulation/de-encapsulation process.

Lab Tasks:

PC1 to PC4 Ping Test:

Traced the MAC addresses at each hop in the route from PC1 to PC4.

Identified source and destination MAC addresses across each network segment:

PC1 → SW1

SW1 → R1

R1 → R2

R2 → R3

R3 → SW2

SW2 → PC4

PC1 to PC3 Ping Test:

Verified local communication within the same LAN segment.

Observed ARP process and MAC resolution between PC1, SW1, and PC3.

PC4 to PC1 Ping Test:

Repeated reverse-path MAC tracking from PC4 back to PC1.

Ensured proper ARP and MAC table entries for bidirectional communication.

Tools Used:

Cisco Packet Tracer

CLI for routers and switches

Simulation Mode for ARP and MAC verification

Key Concepts Practiced:

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

MAC address learning

Encapsulation/De-encapsulation at each OSI layer

End-to-end packet flow in a routed network
