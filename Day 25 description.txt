Day 25 – RIP & EIGRP (CCNA 200-301)

This lab covers the configuration and verification of two important dynamic routing protocols: RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). Using Cisco Packet Tracer and CLI, this session demonstrates how to:


Configure RIP with proper versioning and network statements

Understand RIP's limitations like hop count and slow convergence

Set up EIGRP with Autonomous System numbers

Use key commands like show ip route, show ip protocols, and show ip eigrp neighbors

Compare the operation of RIP vs EIGRP in real scenarios

Day 25 – RIP & EIGRP

This lab dives into two essential distance‑vector routing protocols: RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). Using Cisco Packet Tracer and command‑line interface:

Configure RIP (RIPv1 and RIPv2) including version selection, network definitions, passive‑interface setup, and advertisement of a default route

Run show commands like show ip protocols and show ip route to verify RIP behavior

Enable EIGRP with an autonomous system number, apply wildcard masks, and configure router‑ID

Explore EIGRP metrics, route selection, and unequal‑cost load balancing

Validate EIGRP neighbors and learned routes using show ip eigrp neighbors, show ip protocols, and show ip route

Lab duration: approximately 23 minutes
