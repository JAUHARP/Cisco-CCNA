Today's Networking Concepts
1. Basic Routing Topology

Understood how different subnets (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24) are connected using a router.

Learned how devices (PCs) in different networks communicate via routers using gateway IPs (.254 in each subnet).

2. Decimal to Binary Conversion

Practiced converting decimal numbers (e.g., 221) to binary using positional values (128, 64, 32, etc.).

Reinforced understanding of binary representation in IP addressing and subnetting.

3. IPv4 Address Classes

Learned about IP classes:

Class A: 0-127

Class B: 128-191

Class C: 192-223

Understood how class affects IP range allocation and usage in networks.

4. Subnet Masks

Explored default subnet masks for IP classes:

Class A: /8 → 255.0.0.0

Class B: /16 → 255.255.0.0

Class C: /24 → 255.255.255.0

Understood their binary representations and role in dividing networks.
