DAY 19 -DTP,VTP
================
This lab video covers the configuration of Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of the CCNA 200-301 course. It demonstrates how to manually configure trunk ports, disable automatic DTP negotiation, and set up a VTP domain with server and client modes. The video explains how VTP helps in synchronizing VLAN information across multiple switches, highlights the function of VTP transparent mode, and shows how VLANs behave in different VTP configurations. It also includes security practices like setting VTP passwords to prevent unauthorized updates. This hands-on lab helps reinforce key VLAN and trunking concepts essential for CCNA preparation.
