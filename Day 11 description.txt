Day 11 - Routing Between Two Routers
Learning 1: Connecting Two PCs in Different Routers – Part 1
Learned how to connect two different LANs through separate routers using a third subnet for inter-router communication. Static routes were added manually to allow PC-to-PC communication across routers.
Learning 2: Connecting Two PCs in Different Routers – Part 2
Continuation of part 1, with detailed configuration and testing of the setup using Cisco Packet Tracer. Ensured successful ping between PCs in different networks through properly assigned interfaces and routing.
Lab 1: Lab – Connecting Two PCs in Different Routers (Part 1)
Implemented static routing between two routers in Packet Tracer. Used subnet 192.168.2.0/24 for router interconnection, assigned proper IPs, and configured static routes for cross-LAN communication.
Lab 2: Lab – Connecting Two PCs in Different Routers (Part 2)
Tested and verified the network by pinging across devices. Demonstrated route configuration accuracy and connectivity between end devices through two different routers.
