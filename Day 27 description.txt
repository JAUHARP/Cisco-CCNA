Day 27 - OSPF Configuration (Part 2)

This session continues the deep dive into OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing protocol, as part of the CCNA 200-301 lab series. It covers advanced OSPF concepts including cost calculation, neighbor relationships, Hello/Dead timers, and practical configuration across multiple routers. Hands-on implementation is done using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Key Topics Covered:
- OSPF metric (cost) and interface bandwidth
- Neighbor adjacency and state transitions
- Router ID selection
- Configuring OSPF on Cisco routers
- OSPF troubleshooting using 'show' commands

Tools Used: Cisco Packet Tracer

Day 27 - OSPF Configuration Lab (Part 2)

This lab focuses on advanced OSPF configuration as part of the CCNA 200-301 training. Three routers (R1, R2, R3) are interconnected using serial links, and each router has a loopback interface configured to simulate real-world scenarios. The lab demonstrates OSPF configuration using router IDs, network advertisement, and neighbor formation.

Key Concepts:
- OSPF Router ID selection using loopback interfaces
- OSPF neighbor relationships over serial links
- Network advertisement using the 'network' command
- OSPF process ID and area configuration
- Verifying OSPF neighbors and routing tables

Topology:
R1 <--> R2 <--> R3 (with Loopback interfaces on each router)

Tools Used: Cisco Packet Tracer
