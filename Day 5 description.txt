Understand the structure and components of an Ethernet frame and how data is encapsulated at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.

Key Components of Ethernet Frame:

Preamble: 7-byte pattern used for synchronization.

SFD (Start Frame Delimiter): 1-byte flag indicating the start of the frame.

Destination MAC: 6-byte address of the receiving device.

Source MAC: 6-byte address of the sending device.

Type/Length: Identifies the protocol or length of the payload.

Payload (Packet): Actual data being transmitted.

FCS (Frame Check Sequence): 4-byte CRC used to detect transmission errors.

Key Takeaways:

Ethernet frames ensure proper data delivery across a local network.

Each field has a specific purpose for synchronization, addressing, and error-checking.

Understanding frame structure is essential for network analysis and troubleshooting.
